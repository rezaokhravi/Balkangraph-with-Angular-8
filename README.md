# Balkangraph-with-Angular-8
This is an implementation of the Balkangraph OrgChart.js with Angular 8 framework. This is a free trial version of the balkangraph and so it has some limitations. I have added a filter before the orgchart to add a feature for opening hierarchy for specific teams or departments.

Use ng serve -o to open the development server on 'http://localhost:4200/

# Orgchart

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
